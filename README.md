# Neuralink Fantasy Pseudocode Bonanza 2020

This GitHub repo contains some mix of sci-fi fantasy and maybe a little bit of humor if I get around to it.

DISCLAIMER: I am literally pretending to write code for the 2040 version of Neuralink. If that bothers you, please don't read past this README!

## My Dream Job

Neuralink is a company I'd actually like to work for. The idea of writing software that interacts with peoples's brains -- or my own brain -- is compelling to me. And Musk clearly isn't limited by other peoples' imaginations. I find that admirable.

Unfortunately, I put my odds of working at Neuralink some day at about 0%. It isn't actually zero (nothing's impossible) but the number rounds to zero. So instead of writing the *actual* code for Neuralink, I'm writing pretend code here.

## Forking This Repo

It dawned on me that other people might enjoy writing their own pretend code for Neuralink. So this code is public. I might update it on my own, I might not. We'll see. Please show me what you come up with if you do decide to make some changes!

### Curiosity...

Does it bother anyone that I chose Python over C or C++ for this? I like the aesthetics of Python best so far even though C or C++ would be a better choice *performance wise* for any real Neuralink code (as I understand it).
